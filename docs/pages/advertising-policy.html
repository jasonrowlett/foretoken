      <p>
        Foretoken maintains a strict separation between our editorial and advertising teams.
        Sponsored content is always clearly labeled, and we never allow advertisers to influence
        our reporting or rankings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We accept advertising partnerships that align with our mission and provide
        real value to our audience. We reserve the right to reject any advertiser or
        sponsored material that we find misleading, unethical, or irrelevant to our community.
