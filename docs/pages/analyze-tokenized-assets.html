                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have emerged as one of the most exciting intersections of traditional finance and blockchain technology. From tokenized gold and real estate to treasuries and private credit, these digital representations of tangible assets offer new ways to invest with lower barriers, higher liquidity, and 24/7 market access.
                </p>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  But like any investment, not all tokenized assets are created equal. Savvy investors must learn to assess the fundamentals behind the token—just like they would with stocks, bonds, or commodities.
                </p>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  This guide breaks down the essential steps to analyzing a tokenized asset before you invest.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div classname="mb-8">
                <h2 classname="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">1. Understand What's Being Tokenized</h2>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Before diving into on-chain data or market performance, identify the underlying asset.
                </p>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Ask:</p>
                <ul classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
                  <li>Is it a commodity (e.g., gold, oil)?</li>
                  <li>Is it a security (e.g., government bonds, corporate debt)?</li>
                  <li>Is it real estate or infrastructure?</li>
                  <li>Is it something more abstract, like future yield or carbon credits?</li>
                </ul>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  Understanding what's being tokenized is critical to evaluating the risk profile, expected returns, volatility, and legal classification.

              </div>

              <div classname="mb-8">
                <h2 classname="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">2. Research the Issuer and Custodian</h2>

                  Who is behind the token?

                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  You're not just investing in the asset—you're trusting the issuer, the custodian, and the platform.
                </p>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Check:</p>
                <ul classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
                  <li><strong>Issuer credibility:</strong> Are they regulated? Do they have a history in finance or blockchain?</li>

                  <li><strong>Legal structure:</strong> Is the token a security? Does it comply with MiCA, SEC, or other regulations?</li>

                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The token itself is software.

                  <li><strong>Smart contract audits:</strong> Has the code been audited by a reputable firm?</li>
                  <li><strong>Redemption mechanism:</strong> Can the token be redeemed for the underlying asset? What are the fees and minimums?</li>
                  <li><strong>Supply mechanics:</strong> Is the supply fixed, elastic, or dynamically minted/burned?</li>
                  <li><strong>Token standards:</strong> Is it ERC-20? Does it use newer standards for compliance or interoperability?</li>

                  Even if a token is backed 1:1 with a real asset, it doesn't mean it trades well.
                </p>
                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Look for:</p>
                <ul classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2 mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
                  <li>Daily trading volume</li>
                  <li>Exchange listings (both centralized and decentralized)</li>
                  <li>Bid-ask spreads (tight spreads = healthy liquidity)</li>
                  <li>Whale dominance (do a few wallets control the majority?)</li>

                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                  A token may look strong on paper but lack enough buyers and sellers to exit efficiently.

              <div classname="mb-8">

                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Use tools (like the Foretoken Concourse Dashboard) to compare the token's price movements with its real-world counterpart.

                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Check:</p>

                  <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Is the token more volatile than the physical asset?</li>

                  <li><strong>Events:</strong> Has it ever de-pegged or experienced slippage?</li>

                <p classname="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Does the token offer yield? If so, how and why?

                  <li><strong>Staking rewards or yield farming:</strong> Where does the yield come from? Is it sustainable?</li>

                  <li>Which jurisdiction governs the asset and token?</li>
                  <li>Are there limitations for investors based on geography (e.g., U.S. vs. EU)?</li>

                  Just like startups, many tokenized assets live or die by network effects.
