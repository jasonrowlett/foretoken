Create a sophisticated website for a modern media platform in the style of "Bloomberg Terminal meets the Financial Times". The site is called "Foretoken" and serves as a news, data, and educational hub for the tokenized real-world asset (RWA) market.

### Pages (must be built using React + Vite + ES Modules):
1. Home — headline news, mission statement, and featured data visualizations
2. Library — categorized articles, op-eds, and educational guides
3. Podcast — embedded player with show archive and listening links (Spotify, Apple, etc.)
4. Connect — contact form, speaking request, and consulting services
5. Subscribe — subscription plans with CTA to join newsletter and dashboard access

### Design Requirements:
- UI Framework: TailwindCSS (ensure Tailwind is properly configured with PostCSS plugin)
- Routing: React Router DOM for page navigation
- Layout: Responsive and mobile-first
- Dark mode theme:
  - Background: #000000 or #0a0a0a
  - Accent neon colors: purple (#c084fc) and silver (#d1d5db)
- Fonts:
  - Headings: Notable
  - Subtext: Inter

### Functionality:
- Use functional components (no class components)
- Use React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for all state management
- Use `.tsx` files with TypeScript (optional but preferred)
- Setup project with Vite and `"type": "module"` in package.json
- Do not use `require()` — use ES module syntax: `import`/`export`
- Do not hardcode `localhost` in fetch requests or internal routes
- Ensure preview works inside Replit (server config must use `0.0.0.0` as host)

### Navigation & Structure:
- Fixed top navbar with:
  - Smooth scroll anchors or client-side links
  - Neon glow hover effect (glowing underline animation)
- Footer includes Terms of Service and Privacy Policy (links only, not in navbar)

### Placeholder Content:
- Hero section on Home with tagline: “Bringing Transparency to Tokenized Assets”
- Placeholder article cards in Library
- Placeholder podcast embeds on Podcast page (Spotify + Apple)
- Placeholder CTA form on Subscribe
