              This Advertising Policy ("Policy") governs the terms and conditions under which advertisers ("Advertisers") may place advertisements on Foretoken's properties, including but not limited to the Foretoken website, podcast, and newsletter (collectively, the "Platform"). By purchasing or placing advertising with Foretoken, you agree to comply with this Policy.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              This Policy is issued by Foretoken and its parent company, RGI Enterprises LLC ("we," "us," or "our"), and is subject to change at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Advertisements</h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to review, approve, or reject any advertisement for any reason. Advertisements must be accurate, lawful, and clearly distinguishable from editorial content. We do not accept advertising that contains, promotes, or links to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

              <li>Adult content or services</li>
              <li>Gambling or betting platforms</li>
              <li>Counterfeit or infringing products</li>
              <li>Hate speech, violence, or discriminatory practices</li>
              <li>Political endorsements or campaigns</li>
              <li>Ponzi schemes, rug-pulls, or other financial scams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Foretoken retains full editorial discretion to determine whether an advertisement is appropriate for the Platform.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. Right to Refuse or Terminate</h2>
            <p>
              Foretoken and RGI Enterprises LLC reserve the right to reject, remove, suspend, or terminate any advertising at any time, for any reason, including but not limited to the Advertiser's content, behavior, industry affiliations, or reputation. If an advertisement is terminated early by us, a pro-rated refund may be issued at our sole discretion, but we are under no obligation to do so.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Positioning and Labeling</h2>
            <p>
              We determine the placement, design, and positioning of advertisements. All ads will be clearly labeled as "Sponsored," "Promoted," or "Advertisement" in compliance with applicable advertising laws and best practices. We do not guarantee placement on any specific date, time, or location on our Platform unless explicitly agreed upon in a signed contract.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Advertiser Warranties</h2>
            <p>Advertisers warrant that:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>They own or have full rights to display all ad content, logos, links, trademarks, or other creative materials submitted.</li>
              <li>The content complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and advertising standards.</li>
              <li>No part of the advertisement infringes upon the rights of any third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              Advertisers agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Foretoken, RGI Enterprises LLC, and all affiliated officers, directors, employees, and contractors from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from the advertisement or any breach of this Policy.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. No Endorsement</h2>
            <p>
              Acceptance of advertising does not constitute an endorsement by Foretoken or RGI Enterprises LLC of the advertiser's product, service, or message. We maintain editorial independence and do not allow advertisers to influence our content.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">7. Payment and Cancellation</h2>

            </p>
